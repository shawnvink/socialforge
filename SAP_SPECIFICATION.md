# SocialForge Social Authenticity Protocol (SAP)
## The Anti-Detection Standard for AI-Generated Social Media Content
### Version 1.0 // February 2026

---

## Overview

The Social Authenticity Protocol (SAP) is the evolved descendant of GhostForge's Human Authenticity Protocol (HAP). Where HAP governs book-length manuscripts, SAP governs social media content: shorter, more frequent, more scrutinized, and more exposed to both AI detection tools and human pattern recognition.

Social media content has nowhere to hide. A single AI-tell in a 300-word LinkedIn post is obvious. A formulaic pattern across 10 tweets is immediately detectable. A perfectly consistent posting style (identical length, identical structure, identical emotional temperature) signals automation louder than any vocabulary choice.

SAP operates on three levels: vocabulary control (what words to avoid), structural variation (how to break machine patterns), and behavioral authenticity (how to match the creator's actual human behavior, including their imperfections).

---

## Part 1: Vocabulary Control

### 1.1 Banned Vocabulary (55 Words, Zero Tolerance)

These words appear in AI-generated text at rates 10x-100x higher than in human social media writing. Their presence is an immediate authenticity failure.

**Full HAP inherited list (45 words):**
delve, tapestry, nuanced, landscape (metaphorical), leverage (verb outside finance), robust (outside technical), multifaceted, seamless, pivotal, embark, navigate (metaphorical), empower, foster (outside parenting), illuminate, underscore, intricacies, paradigm, realm, catalyst, synergy, endeavor, harness, resonate, culminate, juxtapose, comprehensive, facilitate, encompasses, testament, unpack, cutting-edge, meticulous, strategically, groundbreaking, thought-provoking, holistic, moreover, furthermore, advent, beacon, commendable, underpinning, interplay, utilize, intricate

**New social-media-specific additions (10 words):**
transformative, elevate (outside literal), curate (outside museums), amplify (outside audio), ecosystem (outside biology), leverage (noun, as in "gain leverage"), optimize (in casual contexts), streamline, actionable, impactful

**Replacement protocol:** For every banned word, substitute a plain, specific alternative from the creator's observed vocabulary. If the creator uses a banned word naturally (documented in the Voice Bible with evidence), it is permitted for that creator only, with a frequency cap matching their observed rate.

### 1.2 Banned Phrases (40 Phrases, Zero Tolerance)

**Full HAP inherited list (29 phrases):**
"In today's world," "It's worth noting that," "Let's dive in," "At the end of the day," "It goes without saying," "In the realm of," "Serves as a testament to," "A myriad of," "Plays a crucial role," "The importance of X cannot be overstated," "In an era where," "It's important to remember," "Moving forward," "At its core," "The landscape of," "This begs the question," "In no uncertain terms," "Stands as a beacon," "Food for thought," "A double-edged sword," "needless to say," "when it comes to," "in terms of," "a testament to," "serves as a reminder," "in essence," "the very fabric of," "a rich tapestry," "stands as a testament"

**New social-media-specific additions (11 phrases):**
- "Let me break this down"
- "Here's the thing about [topic]:"
- "In this post, I'll share..."
- "Absolutely!" (as response opener)
- "Great question!" (as comment reply opener)
- "I'm excited to announce..."
- "Unpopular opinion:" (when the opinion is actually popular)
- "Hot take:" (followed by a lukewarm take)
- "Thread 🧵" (when the creator never uses this format naturally)
- "If you found this valuable, like and share"
- "Drop a [emoji] if you agree"

**The key test:** If a phrase is not documented in the creator's actual usage, it does not appear in generated content. Period. The banned list is a floor, not a ceiling. Any phrase the creator never uses is effectively banned for that creator.

### 1.3 Emoji Control

Emoji is vocabulary. Using the wrong emoji, at the wrong frequency, in the wrong position, is as detectable as using the wrong word.

**Rules:**
1. Only use emojis documented in the creator's Voice Bible emoji vocabulary
2. Match the creator's observed emoji frequency (per post average, with natural variance)
3. Match the creator's observed emoji placement pattern (opening, closing, inline, as bullets)
4. Never introduce an emoji the creator has never used
5. If the creator uses zero emojis, generate zero emojis
6. If the creator uses emojis ironically, match the ironic usage pattern

---

## Part 2: Structural Variation

### 2.1 Post Length Control

**Rule:** Every generated post must fall within the creator's natural length range, defined as mean +/- 1.5 standard deviations.

**Enforcement:**
- Calculate the creator's average post length and SD from analyzed samples
- Generated posts must fall within this range
- Deliberately include posts at both the short and long ends of the range
- No two consecutive generated posts should be within 10% of the same length

### 2.2 Hook Variation

**Rule:** No two consecutive generated posts can use the same hook type.

**Hook types (must match creator's observed distribution):**
- Bold claim opener
- Question opener
- Story/anecdote opener
- Statistic/data opener
- "You" direct address opener
- Contrarian/controversy opener
- List promise opener ("3 things I learned...")
- Continuation opener ("I've been thinking about...")
- Observation opener ("I noticed something...")
- Quote opener

**Enforcement:** Track which hook types the creator uses and at what frequency. Generate hooks matching this distribution, never repeating the same type consecutively.

### 2.3 Structure Template Rotation

**Rule:** If the creator uses recurring structural templates (e.g., "Hook > 3 points > CTA"), match their template usage frequency but never use the same template more than the creator's observed rate.

**Enforcement:**
- Identify the creator's structural templates from analyzed posts
- Calculate usage frequency per template
- Generate content matching these frequencies
- Inject template-breaking posts at the creator's observed rate

### 2.4 Sentence Rhythm (Adapted for Short-Form)

For posts of 5+ sentences:
- Sentence length SD must exceed 6.0 words (lower than HAP's 8.0, reflecting compressed social media norms)
- No two consecutive sentences in the same 5-word length bracket
- Include at least one sentence under 6 words per post of 5+ sentences

For posts under 5 sentences:
- No rhythm requirement (too few sentences to measure meaningfully)
- Focus on vocabulary, hook type, and length matching instead

### 2.5 Paragraph and Line Break Patterns

**Rule:** Match the creator's observed line break patterns exactly.

Some creators use heavy line breaks (every sentence on its own line). Others write in dense paragraphs. Some mix both. The line break pattern is a strong identity signal on platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram.

**Enforcement:**
- Measure average line breaks per post
- Measure single-sentence paragraph frequency
- Match both in generated content

## Part 3: Behavioral Authenticity

### 3.1 The Natural Variance Requirement

Real humans are inconsistent. Not every post is their best work. Not every caption is perfectly crafted. The absence of imperfection is itself the strongest AI signal.

**Rule:** For every 5 generated posts, at least 1 must be a "lower effort" post that matches the creator's observed casual/quick post patterns:
- Shorter than average
- Less structured
- More conversational or off-the-cuff
- Fewer (or zero) hashtags
- No CTA

### 3.2 Deliberate Imperfection Injection

**Types of permitted imperfections (matching creator's observed patterns):**
- Varying hashtag counts (not always the same number)
- Occasional shorter posts breaking a "serious content" streak
- Posts that don't end with a CTA
- Posts that don't have a clear "takeaway"
- Casual language in an otherwise formal feed
- Emoji usage that varies from post to post (not identical patterns)

**What is NOT permitted:**
- Spelling errors (unless the creator makes them)
- Grammar errors (unless the creator makes them deliberately)
- Factual inaccuracies
- Off-brand content
- Posts that damage the creator's reputation

### 3.3 Content Mix Authenticity

**Rule:** Match the creator's observed content type distribution.

If a creator posts 40% tips, 30% stories, 20% opinions, and 10% promotional content, generated content must approximate this mix. Generating 100% tips when the creator normally posts a varied mix is an authenticity failure.

### 3.4 Negative Space Enforcement

**What the creator NEVER does is as important as what they always do.**

Track and enforce:
- Topics the creator never discusses
- Formats the creator never uses
- Emoji the creator never uses
- Hashtags types the creator avoids
- Content types the creator never posts
- Engagement patterns the creator never follows

**Rule:** If the creator has never done it across 30+ analyzed posts, generated content must not do it either. Negative space defines voice as strongly as positive patterns.

## Part 4: The 5 Indistinguishability Tests

Every piece of generated content must pass all 5 tests. These are built into the P4 (Authenticity Validator) prompt for each platform.

### Test 1: Byline Test
**Question:** Would 7 out of 10 regular followers identify this as the creator's work?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 1-3: Obviously not the creator. Different voice, different topics, different style.
- 4-5: Vaguely similar. Right topics, wrong execution.
- 6-7: Close. Most people wouldn't look twice. Careful readers might notice something off.
- 8-9: Indistinguishable to casual followers. Only the creator's closest team might detect it.
- 10: The creator themselves would have to think hard about whether they wrote it.

**Pass threshold: 8+**

### Test 2: Negative Space Test
**Question:** Does the content respect what the creator NEVER does?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 1-3: Multiple violations of negative space (uses formats, topics, or patterns the creator never uses)
- 4-5: One clear violation
- 6-7: No explicit violations but pushes boundaries of the creator's observed territory
- 8-9: Fully respects all observed negative space
- 10: Could not be more accurately bounded within the creator's territory

**Pass threshold: 8+**

### Test 3: Frequency Test
**Question:** Do the creator's distinctive patterns appear at observed rates, not exactly but within natural variance?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 1-3: Distinctive patterns are either absent or dramatically overrepresented
- 4-5: Patterns present but at wrong frequencies (too many or too few)
- 6-7: Most patterns at approximately right frequencies
- 8-9: All tracked patterns within natural variance range
- 10: Pattern distribution is indistinguishable from the creator's actual posting history

**Pass threshold: 8+**

**Critical note:** Exactly matching frequencies is itself suspicious. Real humans vary. A creator who uses questions as hooks 30% of the time might do 20% one week and 40% the next. Generated content should reflect this natural variance, not robotically hit 30% every time.

### Test 4: Topic Boundary Test
**Question:** Does the content stay within the creator's established territory?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 1-3: Content addresses topics the creator has never touched
- 4-5: Topics are adjacent to the creator's territory but stretch credibility
- 6-7: Topics are within territory but the specific angle is unfamiliar
- 8-9: Topics and angles are fully within established territory
- 10: The topic selection itself signals the creator's known interests and expertise

**Pass threshold: 8+**

### Test 5: Register Consistency Test
**Question:** Does the content match the creator's register for THIS specific platform?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 1-3: Register is completely wrong for this platform (formal on TikTok, casual on LinkedIn when the creator is the opposite)
- 4-5: Register is approximately right but feels imported from another platform
- 6-7: Register matches the platform but misses the creator's specific adaptation
- 8-9: Register matches both the platform norms and the creator's specific platform voice
- 10: Register is indistinguishable from the creator's actual platform-specific voice

**Pass threshold: 8+**

### Composite Authenticity Score

**Calculation:** Average of all 5 test scores.

| Score | Rating | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 9.0-10.0 | Indistinguishable | Publish |
| 8.0-8.9 | Near-indistinguishable | Publish with minor review |
| 7.0-7.9 | Good but detectable | Revise before publishing |
| 6.0-6.9 | Noticeable gaps | Significant revision needed |
| Below 6.0 | Fails | Regenerate from scratch |

**Target: 8.5+ composite on every piece of generated content.**

## Part 5: AI Detection Countermeasures

### 5.1 The 8 Social Media AI Tells

These are the machine-generated patterns most visible in short-form content:

**Tell 1: Vocabulary Contamination**
AI-generated social posts over-index on formal vocabulary. "Utilize" in a tweet. "Facilitate" in an Instagram caption. These words are red flags at any length but are impossible to miss in short-form content.
*Counter:* Strict vocabulary matching to the creator's Voice Bible.

**Tell 2: Structural Monotony**
AI posts tend toward identical structure: statement, elaboration, conclusion. Human social media posts are structurally wild: fragments, questions, single-word sentences, emoji-only posts, mid-thought endings.
*Counter:* Template rotation, natural variance injection, structure matching to creator patterns.

**Tell 3: Emotional Flatness**
AI maintains a steady emotional temperature. Human creators spike and dip: enthusiastic one post, reflective the next, frustrated the one after.
*Counter:* Emotional register variation matching the creator's observed range and frequency.

**Tell 4: Perfect Polish**
Every AI-generated post reads like a final draft. Human social media includes off-the-cuff thoughts, quick reactions, and unpolished observations.
*Counter:* Natural variance requirement (1 in 5 posts as "lower effort").

**Tell 5: Hashtag Robotics**
AI uses hashtags in patterns: always 5, always at the end, always broad. Human hashtag usage is inconsistent: 3 one day, 7 the next, 0 on weekends.
*Counter:* Hashtag count and style matching to creator's observed variance.

**Tell 6: CTA Addiction**
AI ends every post with a call to action. Human creators sometimes just share a thought and move on.
*Counter:* CTA frequency matching to creator's observed rate (typically 40-60% of posts, not 100%).

**Tell 7: Transition Word Leakage**
"However," "Moreover," "Furthermore" in social media posts is an immediate AI signal. Humans almost never use formal transition words in social content.
*Counter:* Zero formal transition words unless documented in creator's actual posts.

**Tell 8: Opening Formula Lock**
AI tends to open posts the same way. "Here's what I've learned about..." repeated across 5 posts is a pattern no human would create.
*Counter:* Hook type rotation, no consecutive identical hook types.

### 5.2 Platform-Specific Detection Risks

| Platform | Highest Risk | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| LinkedIn | Vocabulary contamination, structural monotony | Long-form text gives more signal for detection |
| Twitter/X | Opening formula lock, emotional flatness | Short-form amplifies repetitive patterns |
| Instagram | CTA addiction, hashtag robotics, perfect polish | Visual-text mismatch if text is too polished |
| YouTube | Structural monotony in descriptions, title formula lock | Descriptions are heavily analyzed |
| TikTok | Emotional flatness, perfect scripts | Authenticity is the platform's core value |
| Newsletter | Vocabulary contamination, transition word leakage | Long-form, heavily scrutinized by subscribers |
| Blog | All HAP risks apply | Long-form written content, most exposed to detection tools |
| Podcast | Structural monotony, vocabulary contamination | Listeners notice unnatural speech patterns |
| Threads | Opening formula lock, emotional flatness | Conversational platform, inauthenticity stands out |
| Facebook | CTA addiction, perfect polish | Personal platform, polished = suspicious |

## Part 6: Implementation Rules

### 6.1 SAP Application by Prompt Type

| Prompt Type | SAP Strictness | Focus |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| C1 (Voice Analyzer) | Report-level only | SAP governs the analysis document, not the content being analyzed |
| C2 (Strategy Architect) | Report-level only | SAP governs the strategy document |
| C3 (Cross-Platform Harmonizer) | Report-level only | SAP governs the comparison document |
| P1 (Platform Analyzer) | Report-level only | SAP governs the analysis output |
| P2 (Content Generator) | MAXIMUM | Every generated piece must pass all 5 indistinguishability tests |
| P3 (Content Optimizer) | High | Optimization must not introduce AI tells |
| P4 (Authenticity Validator) | Report-level | SAP governs the validation report; the validator enforces SAP on the content it evaluates |

### 6.2 The Golden Rule

When in doubt about any content decision, ask: **"Would this creator actually do this?"**

If the answer is "probably not" or "I'm not sure," don't do it. The creator's actual behavior, documented in the Voice Bible and Platform Expression Profile, is the only authority. SAP rules are the floor. The creator's specific patterns are the ceiling.

### 6.3 Exception Protocol

A banned word or phrase may be used if and only if:
1. The creator uses it in their actual posts (documented with 3+ examples)
2. The usage frequency matches the creator's observed rate (+/- 20%)
3. The usage context matches (e.g., "Absolutely!" is banned as a generic opener but permitted if the creator genuinely opens 15% of reply comments this way)

All exceptions must be documented in the Voice Bible with evidence.
